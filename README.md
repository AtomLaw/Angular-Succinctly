# Angular Succinctly
This is the companion repo for Angular Succinctly by Joseph D. Booth. Published by Syncfusion.

This repository contains the source files for the Soccer Dashboard application.
To build the application after downloading the files, perform the following steps.

Copy the entire folder/file structure into a directory on your local machine
There is no package-lock.json file, nor a node_modules directory in the repo
Change into the folder and run
NPM Install

This will create the necessary node_modules folder and download necessary files
It will also create the package-lock.json file

Once this step is done, you can run the application.

NG serve --open
